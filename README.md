# Dialogue-System-Tutorial
This shows how to implement a simple dialogue system in 2D



# Pre: Settings
Make sure the game project is in 1920x1080 pixel measurements, rather than just 16:9 (default setting) in order to allow for specific measurements for the sizes of the text box etc to be down to the pixel.



# 1) Creating the dialogue box
Start by creating a canvas in the hierarchy of your project, as follows:

Then, add an empty game object within the canvas as a child, and name is DialogueBox:

After creating that, click on the button for orientation, then Shift+Alt to have the option to put the box at the bottom middle of the canvas, then proceed to make the opbesct 1400 pixels wide and 250 pixels tall:

Then, add some graphics to the text box so that it can be seen in the Canvas, and to do that you right click on DialogueBox, UI, Image and fill the box by clicking the same orientation button, Shift+Alt and clicking the fill button:
